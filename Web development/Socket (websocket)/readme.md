# Socket
A socket is a low-level bidirectional network interface. Sockets can be used for both TCP and UDP protocols.<br>

- socket(): creates a socket
- bind():  associates the socket with a local address
- listen(): gets the socket ready to accept client connection requests
- accept(), send(), receive(), close(): literal

# Socket example
## Server
~~~python
import socket, threading

# Create client socket where address family is IPv4 and socket type is TCP
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# To solve WinError 10048 error 
server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

def bind():
    for port in range(9000,9999):
        try:
            server_socket.bind(("127.0.0.1", port))
            print(f"Bound to {port}")
            break
        except:
            continue

def request_parser(message):
    # Parsing
    params=[]
    beginning_of_string=0
    for i in range(len(message)):
        if message[i]==',': # Distinguisher found
            params.append(message[beginning_of_string:i])
            beginning_of_string=i+1
        if i==len(message)-1: # Last index
            params.append(message[beginning_of_string:])
    return params

def client_data_receiver(accepted_client, address):
    while True:
        try:
            # Wait for client's request
            message = accepted_client.recv(999).decode() # Convert the received message that is bytes to a string object and print it
        except:
            print(f'{address} disconnected')
            accepted_client.close()
            return
        params=request_parser(message)
        for i in range(len(params)):
            print(f'Received {params[i]} from {address}')
            accepted_client.sendall(f'Echo from server'.encode()) # Send the received message back to client (echo)

def client_accepter():
    while True:
        accepted_client, address = server_socket.accept() # Accept the client socket
        print(f'Connected by {address}')
        threading.Thread(target=client_data_receiver, args=(accepted_client, address)).start()

bind()
server_socket.listen() # Be ready to get incoming connection requests
client_accepter()

## Client
~~~python
import socket

# Create client socket where address family is IPv4 and socket type is TCP
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
for port in range(9000,9999):
    try:
        client_socket.connect(("127.0.0.1", port))
        print(f"Bound to {port}")
        break
    except:
        continue

while True:
    message = input()
    if message=='':
        break

    client_socket.sendall(message.encode()) # Send the message

    # Receive the echo message from server
    try:
        data = client_socket.recv(999) # Wait for client's request
        print(f'Received {data.decode()} from server') # Convert the received message that is bytes to a string object and print it
    except:
        print(f'server disconnected')
        client_socket.close()
        break

# Websocket
WebSocket is a higher-level protocol specifically designed for web over TCP, which uses HTTP in the initial handshake process to establish the connection, and then upgrades the connection to a two-way real-time communication channel.

1. Request: The client sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate the WebSocket connection
2. Response: The server responds with an HTTP 101 status code (Switching Protocols) and includes an "Upgrade" header with a value of "websocket" in the response.
3. WebSocket Connection Established and data exchange
4. Connection Termination: Either the client or the server sends a message to close the WebSocket connection.
